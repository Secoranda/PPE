# Laboratory work analysis
## Description 
That's a Windows application.
 
In this laboratory work was needed to convert a previous laboratory work from cpp in c#. I've chosen laboratory work nr.3, paint program.
 
Comparing these two languages, I'll mention that in c# functions are easier to implement and looks better as interface,  however didn't have enough time to study deeper the c#.

In c# to create buttons or a menu is pretty the same. It doesn't involve much work. So for a better look i've chosen a menu.

Was implemented the window for drawing. Some shapes: circle, rectangle and triangle. There is a pen and a line option. Also, a clear button. 
On button width, there are 3 width options: thin, medium and thick. And on style button is possible to change and to make shapes to be filled or unfilled and to choose a color. Actually, color option is better in c# than in cpp where you have to declare each color.

To make changes to happen, there is a kind of action on click, that captures the messages from the window according which are done next changes.

To sum up I'll mention that already I got used with c++ and it took some time to change on another method.
